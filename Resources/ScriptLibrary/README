Hello! Welcome to the script library where you can copy our scripts, and put them in your game! Here's is a little introduction.
At the top of every script you will see a little bit of text saying what type of script the script is, for example:

scriptInfo(Do not put in your script{
  scriptType = Regular
  typeTime = ~5m
  Level = Easy
  
  }
  
And then the script starts. MAKE SURE NOT TO COPY THE scriptInfo table!
